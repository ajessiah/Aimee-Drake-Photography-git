                Hi, I’m Aimee Drake, a passionate photographer dedicated to capturing the beauty and emotion in every moment. 
                With over a decade of experience behind the lens, I specialize in portrait, lifestyle, and nature photography that tells your unique story.

                Photography isn’t just my profession — it’s my way of seeing the world. 
                Whether it’s the glow of golden hour, the sparkle in a child’s eye, or the quiet strength of a landscape, I strive to create images that evoke feeling and preserve memories for a lifetime.

                When I’m not photographing, you can find me exploring scenic trails, experimenting with new creative techniques, or curled up with a good book and a cup of coffee. 
                I believe every photo should be as authentic and meaningful as the person in front of the camera.
                <br>

                Thank you for visiting my site. 
                I’d love to work with you and help capture your special moments in a way that feels natural, timeless, and truly you.
