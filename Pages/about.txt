Born and raised in the mountains of western North Carolina, I developed a deep love for nature and the outdoors early in life. 
<br>
<br>
In 1997, I moved to Portland, Oregon, where I took my first photography class—Darkroom Essentials for 35mm black-and-white film—and discovered a lifelong passion for visual storytelling. 
<br>
<br>
Photography quickly became a personal outlet for artistic expression. In 2000, I became a licensed real estate broker and began using my photography skills to showcase properties in compelling ways. 
<br>
<br>
Over time, I expanded my experience by collaborating with a commercial photographer, working on a wide range of projects including corporate campaigns, individual portraits, food, product, and real estate photography.
<br>
<br>
Now back in the mountains of western North Carolina, I’ve returned to my roots and am launching my own real estate photography business—combining my love of the craft with a keen eye for visual detail.
<br>
<br>
I enjoy working with owners and managers of both long and short term rental properties as well as real estate brokers listing properties for sale. In any of these types of real estate photography, photos serve as the first point of contact between a property and potential tenants, guests, or buyers, making them a critical marketing tool. 
<br>
<br>
High-quality images capture attention instantly, creating a strong first impression that can drive interest and highlight the home's best features. This can influence a buyer’s or tenant’s decision to schedule a viewing, and a potential guest’s decision to reserve a stay at your property.
